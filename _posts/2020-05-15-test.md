### Solving 2-D Heat Transfer problem using Python 

The following tries solves the classical conduction-convection problem in a 2-dimension problem. The goal is to reproduce the temperature distribution in a domain composed by two blocks of different thermal properties. A centrally located zone is constantly at a higher temperature and the two blocks do not exchange heat (ideally a vacuum between them).  

The following image shows the problem to be solved.

#### The Heat Transfer Equation
The heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes how the distribution of some quantity (in this case, heat) evolves over time in a solid medium, as it spontaneously flows from places where it is higher towards places where it is lower. It is a special case of the diffusion equation. This equation was first developed and solved by Joseph Fourier in 1822 to describe heat flow.

In the special cases of propagation of heat in an aniisotropic and homogeneous medium in a 2-dimensional space, the heat flow equation results in the following

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{d} t} = Dx\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + Dy\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}" title="2D heat transfer equation" />

where Dx and Dy are the thermal diffusivity and is related to the thermal conductivity, material density and heat capacity as:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;D = \frac{K}{\rho C}" title="Diffusivity relation" />

In order to solve this equation numerically, the strategy here usede is to apply finite difference approximations in the first equation, resulting in the following expression.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\frac{T_{i,j}^{(n+1)} - T_{i,j}^{(n)}}{\Delta t}  = D_x \frac{T_{i+1,j}^{(n)} - 2T_{i,j}^{(n)} +T_{i-1,j}^{(n)} }{(\Delta x)^2} +  D_y \frac{T_{i,j+1}^{(n)} - 2T_{i,j}^{(n)} +T_{i,j-1}^{(n)} }{(\Delta y)^2}" title="Finite difference approximation" />

Thus, the state of the system at time step n+1, is calculated from its state at time step n. The following code applies the above finite difference approximation in order to calculate the evolution of a temperature field in a domain composed by two blocks with different thermal properties. Before starting the code, it is important to highlightthat the maximun time step Î”t that results in stable propagation is:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\Delta t = \frac{1}{D_{max}}\frac{(\Delta x\Delta y)^2}{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}" title="Max time step" />

#### Python Code
We are ready for the source code. Before starting, the code here described was developed on python 2.7. The first step is to import necessary modules.
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
import glob
import itertools
```

In sequence, it was defined the time step and set the "plot window grafical output" 

```python
#Set Time Step
dt=0.0002
# Set colour interpolation and colour map.
# You can try set it to 10, or 100 to see the difference
# You can also try: colourMap = plt.cm.coolwarm
colorinterpolation = 50
colourMap = plt.cm.jet
```

Next, a grid generator function and the finite difference approximation function are defined.

```python
# Grid Generator
def do_grid(nxmin, nxmax, nymin, nymax):
    gridX, gridY = np.meshgrid(np.arange(nxmin, nxmax), np.arange(nymin, nymax))
    return gridX, gridY
# Finite Difference Approximation
def do_timestep(u0, u,kx,ky):
#Function to calculate temperature
    u[1:-1, 1:-1] = u0[1:-1, 1:-1] + kx* dt * ((u0[2:, 1:-1] - 2*u0[1:-1, 1:-1] + u0[:-2, 1:-1])/dx2 )+ ky* dt * ( (u0[1:-1, 2:] - 2*u0[1:-1, 1:-1] + u0[1:-1, :-2])/dy2 )

    u0 = u.copy()
    return u0, u
```

Alright. Now we have aready set the 2 functions needed for this code: (I) The grid, to calculate the temperature at each element and (II) the finite difference calculation at each time-step. In the following, we will set the dimensions, intervals (dx, dy), number of elements, thermal properties and boundary conditions for the Part 1 (bottom adherent).

```python
#------------------------ PART 1---------------------------

# Set Dimension 
lenX = lenY = 20 #we set it rectangular
# intervals in x-, y- directions
dx = dy = 0.1
dx2 = dx*dx
dy2 = dy*dy
#number of elements 
nx1 = int(lenX/dx)
ny1 = int(lenY/dy)
# Thermal diffusivity in X
Dx1 = 1.
# Thermal diffusivity in y
Dy1 = 1.
# Initial Temperature of interior grid
T1ini = 20
# Boundary condition
T1 = np.empty((nx1, ny1))
T1.fill(T1ini) # Set array size and set the interior value with T1ini
T1[(ny1-1), int(0.2*nx1):int(0.8*nx1+1)] = 100
T10=T1.copy()
```

Here was defined that the temperature at whole domain defined by the PART 1 was set as T1ini = 20, except the top centrally located region defined on 20%-80% in the longitudinal range (T1[(ny1-1), int(0.2*nx1):int(0.8*nx1+1)] = 100), which is at 100. Next, it is generated a X,Y grid vectors for Part 1.

```python
# Set Dimension 
 Set meshgrid
def do_grid(nxmin, nxmax, nymin, nymax):
    gridX, gridY = np.meshgrid(np.arange(nxmin, nxmax), np.arange(nymin, nymax))
    return gridX, gridY
gridX, gridY=do_grid(0,nx1,0,ny1)
X1=gridX[1,:]
Y1=gridY[:,1]
#------------------------ END PART 1---------------------------
```

Great! For now, we have finished all the mesh and material properties related to Part 1. Analogously, we will follow the same procedure to deal with Part 2 (top adherent). However, we must be aware that Part 2 mesh has an offset of ny1 elements in Y diretion, meaning that Part2 is located on top of Part 1.

```python
#------------------------ PART 2---------------------------
lenX = lenY = 20 #we set it rectangular
# intervals in x-, y- directions, mm
dx = dy = 0.1
dx2 = dx*dx
dy2 = dy*dy
#number of elements 
nx2 = int(lenX/dx)
ny2 = int(lenY/dy)
# Thermal diffusivity in X, mm2.s-1
Dx2 = 10.
# Thermal diffusivity in y, mm2.s-1
Dy2 = 10.
# Initial Temperature of interior grid
T2ini = 20
# Boundary condition
T2 = np.empty((nx2, ny2))
T2.fill(T2ini) # Set array size and set the interior value with T2ini
T2[0, int(0.2*nx2):int(0.8*nx2+1)] = Tbottom 
T20=T2.copy()



# Set meshgrid
gridX, gridY=do_grid(0,nx2,nx1,ny2+ny1)
X2=gridX[1,:]
Y2=gridY[:,1]

#------------------------ END PART 2---------------------------
```
Two differences between Part 1 and Part 2 can be noted. (I) For Part 2, the hot zone is located at the bottom, while for Part 1 is at the top; (II) as mentioned before, the Y grid of Part 2 has an offset of ny1.

Now, the next step is to create a common domain and finally solve the heat transfer equation. Lets start creating a commond domain. It checks if the coordenates of Domain 1 and Domain 2 are different and, in this is the case, it copies domain 2 after domain 1.

```python
#Merging Domains
DomainX=[]
DomainY=[]

#Checking X coordenates. If are different, domain 2 is copied after domain 1
if  (X1!=X2).all():
    for item in itertools.chain(X1, X2):
        DomainX.append(item)
    np.reshape(DomainX, (1, nx1+ny1))
    DomainX=np.asarray(DomainX)
else:
    DomainX = X1
#Checking Y coordenates. If are different, domain 2 is copied after domain 1
if  (Y1!=Y2).all():    
    for item in itertools.chain(Y1, Y2):
        DomainY.append(item)
    np.reshape(DomainY, (1, ny1+ny2))
    DomainY=np.asarray(DomainY)
else:
    DomainY = Y1
```

Now, lets finally solve the heat transfer equation and store the field at certain time-steps. In our case, the calculation will be done over 10.000 time-steps (total time = 10000 x dt = 10000 x 0.0002 = 2.) and we will store one field image every 500 steps.
```python
# Number of timesteps
nsteps = 10001
mfig=[]
for i in range (0,nsteps,500):
    mfig.append(i)
fignum = 0
fig = plt.figure()
AllT=[]
for m in range(nsteps):
    T10, T1 = do_timestep(T10,T1,Dx1,Dy1)
    T20, T2 = do_timestep(T20,T2,Dx2,Dy2)
    T0all= np.concatenate((T20, T10), axis=0)
    Tall = np.concatenate((T1, T2), axis=0)
    if m in mfig:
        plt.clf()
        fignum += 1
        print(m, fignum)
        plt.pcolormesh(DomainX*dx,DomainY*dy,Tall,vmin=0, vmax=100,cmap=colourMap)
#        plt.contourf(X, Y, T0,Vmin=0, Vmax=100 colorinterpolation, cmap=colourMap)
        # Set Colorbar
        plt.colorbar()
        plt.savefig('HeatTransfer' + str("%03d" %fignum) + '.jpg')
```
Finally, lets generate a GIF. At this point it is important to mention that your .py script needs to be inside an empty folder. Running the script, the .jpg images will be stored in the same folder as or .py and the .GIF will be generated with all the images found in the folder.
```python
frames = []
imgs = glob.glob("*.jpg")
for i in imgs:
    new_frame = Image.open(i)
    frames.append(new_frame)
    print(i)
 
# Save into a GIF file that loops forever
frames[0].save('temperature.gif', format='GIF',
               append_images=frames[1:],
               save_all=True,
               duration=200, loop=0)
```

The .gif should look like this (reload this page if no animation is shown).

Notice that this example considers that NO HEAT EXCHANGE between Part 1 and Part 2 takes place, meaning that they are solved INDIVIDUALLY.

That is it! You can play around with the variables and check the results!!!
